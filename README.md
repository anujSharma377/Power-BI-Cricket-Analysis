## Power-BI-Cricket-Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to use data analytics and Power BI to identify the best possible Team 11 for the upcoming T20 World Cup in 2022. The analysis will leverage historical player performance data from T20 matches to assess individual players' strengths, weaknesses, and overall contributions to their respective teams. By combining this data with strategic insights and match conditions, we aim to provide valuable recommendations to optimize the selection of players and create the most competitive Team 11 for the T20 World Cup.
